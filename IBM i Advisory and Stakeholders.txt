Hi all

  a whole week has passed and I haven't noticed any message on the topic of this new channel... 
So I started wondering who was supposed to write first! 
I will catch this opportunity.

First of all, why not stressing the topic wording?

"
NO IBM CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
Collaboration surrounding compilers technologies on IBM i
"


A) Does the IBM Confidential notice reduce the scope from "compilers technologies on IBM i" to "compilers technologies on IBM i PASE"?

B) Shouldn't we adopt a broader perspective also including the ILE process model destiny/positioning?

C) Is it conceivable to adopt Open Source Compiler technology for intermediate-code generation in order to retain the renowned benefits of observability and automatic machine retranslation of program/module objects? 

A safe and enjoyable week-end to everyone!
